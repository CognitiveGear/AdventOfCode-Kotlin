# AdventOfCode-Kotlin

My attempt at the Advent of Code[aoc] in Kotlin using Jetbrain's [Advent of Code Kotlin Template][template].

If you're running it in IntelliJ you will need to make sure the run configuration is set to the correct working
directory for each day, otherwise the read_lines function in Utils won't work.
